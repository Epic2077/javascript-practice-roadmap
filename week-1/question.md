# Mission: The Novice Developer's Challenge

Welcome to your first JavaScript mission! Each stage will help you build your skills step by step.

---

## Stage 1: Introduce Yourself to the Teacher

**Your Task:**

- Ask the user to enter their first name, last name, and age.
- Display this information in the console so your teacher can see it.

---

## Stage 2: Understanding Differences

**Your Task:**

- Research the differences between `let`, `var`, and `const` and display them in the console.

---

## Stage 3: Mirror Look

**Your Task:**

- Get two inputs from the user.
- Display these inputs in reverse order in the console.

---

## Stage 4: Mathematical Calculations

**Your Task:**

- Get a number from the user.
- Display various results like the number's negation, 20th power, Boolean value, and remainder when divided by 2 in the console.

---

## Stage 5: Naming Variables

**Your Task:**

- Assign suitable names and data types to the following variables:
  - User's name (string)
  - Pi number (number)
  - Google's domain (string)
  - User's ID (number or string depending on format)
  - Delay duration (number)

---

## Stage 6: Determining Data Types

**Your Task:**

- Specify the data types of the following:
  - "maktab" // string
  - 3 + 2 // number (5)
  - "4" + 4 // string ("44") - concatenation
  - 122222332232322232323232232321n // bigint
  - 5 || 1 // number (5) - logical OR returns the first truthy value
  - 5 && 0 // number (0) - logical AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if all are truthy
  - 5 \* "33" // number (165) - string "33" is coerced to a number
  - null // object (historical JavaScript bug, but typeof null returns "object")

---

## Stage 7: Age Confirmation

**Your Task:**

- Ask the user to enter their age.
- Then ask the user to confirm if the entered age is correct or not.
- If correct, display a message showing how old they are.

---

## Stage 8: Code Execution Order

**Your Task:**

- Explain the execution order of different code in scripts and why.

---

## Stage 9: Expression Output

**Your Task:**

- Find the output of the following expressions without executing the code:
  - `let item = 3` // item is 3
  - `const temp = ++item` // Pre-increment: item becomes 4, temp is assigned 4
  - `item = temp++` // item is assigned temp's current value (4), then temp is incremented to 5
  - `let stars = " *** "` // stars is the string " \*\*\* "
  - `stars = 2 + " *** " * 3` // " _\*\* " _ 3 is NaN, so 2 + NaN is NaN
  - `let flag = false` // flag is false
  - `flag = flag++` // Post-increment: The original value (false) is assigned back to flag, then the increment tries to convert false to a number (0) and adds 1, but this result is not stored anywhere. flag remains false.

---

## Stage 10: Math Question

**Your Task:**

- Create a math question and ask the user to answer it.
- If the answer is correct, display the message "Won", and if it's wrong, display "Game Over".

---

## Stage 11: Even or Odd Number

**Your Task:**

- Get a number from the user and check if it is even or odd.
- Display the result in an alert box.
