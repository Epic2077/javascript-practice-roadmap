# 🌟 Mission: The Novice Developer's Challenge

Welcome to your first JavaScript mission! Each stage will help you build your skills step by step. Enjoy the journey! 🎮

---

## 🧑‍💻 Stage 1: Introduce Yourself to the Teacher

> **Your Task:**
>
> 📝 Ask the user to enter their first name, last name, and age.
> 🖥️ Display this information in the console so your teacher can see it.

---

## 🧠 Stage 2: Understanding Differences

> **Your Task:**
>
> 🔍 Research the differences between `let`, `var`, and `const` and display them in the console.

---

## 🔄 Stage 3: Mirror Look

> **Your Task:**
>
> 🔢 Get two inputs from the user.
> 🔁 Display these inputs in reverse order in the console.

---

## ➗ Stage 4: Mathematical Calculations

> **Your Task:**
>
> 🔢 Get a number from the user.
> 🧮 Display various results like the number's negation, 20th power, Boolean value, and remainder when divided by 2 in the console.

---

## 🏷️ Stage 5: Naming Variables

> **Your Task:**
>
> ✍️ Assign suitable names and data types to the following variables:
>
> - User's name (string)
> - Pi number (number)
> - Google's domain (string)
> - User's ID (number or string depending on format)
> - Delay duration (number)

---

## 🧪 Stage 6: Determining Data Types

> **Your Task:**
>
> 🧩 Specify the data types of the following:
>
> - "maktab" // string
> - 3 + 2 // number (5)
> - "4" + 4 // string ("44") - concatenation
> - 122222332232322232323232232321n // bigint
> - 5 || 1 // number (5) - logical OR returns the first truthy value
> - 5 && 0 // number (0) - logical AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if all are truthy
> - 5 \* "33" // number (165) - string "33" is coerced to a number
> - null // object (historical JavaScript bug, but typeof null returns "object")

---

## 🎂 Stage 7: Age Confirmation

> **Your Task:**
>
> 🎂 Ask the user to enter their age.
> ✅ Then ask the user to confirm if the entered age is correct or not.
> 📢 If correct, display a message showing how old they are.

---

## 📜 Stage 8: Code Execution Order

> **Your Task:**
>
> 📜 Explain the execution order of different code in scripts and why.

---

## 🧮 Stage 9: Expression Output

> **Your Task:**
>
> 🧮 Find the output of the following expressions without executing the code:
>
> - `let item = 3` // item is 3
> - `const temp = ++item` // Pre-increment: item becomes 4, temp is assigned 4
> - `item = temp++` // item is assigned temp's current value (4), then temp is incremented to 5
> - `let stars = " *** "` // stars is the string " \*\*\* "
> - `stars = 2 + " *** " * 3` // " _\*\* " _ 3 is NaN, so 2 + NaN is NaN
> - `let flag = false` // flag is false
> - `flag = flag++` // Post-increment: The original value (false) is assigned back to flag, then the increment tries to convert false to a number (0) and adds 1, but this result is not stored anywhere. flag remains false.

## ❓ Stage 10: Math Question

> **Your Task:**
>
> ❓ Create a math question and ask the user to answer it.
> 🏆 If the answer is correct, display the message "Won", and if it's wrong, display "Game Over".

---

## 🔢 Stage 11: Even or Odd Number

> **Your Task:**
>
> 🔢 Get a number from the user and check if it is even or odd.
> 📢 Display the result in an alert box.
